# unemployed bot 9000
This is a fun project I made for an youtube video to automatically reply to all the reels that I receive using AI.
This bot works by basically taking the top 3 comments of an received instagram reel and sending it to an AI and letting it generate an appropriate response

## ðŸ”§ How to Set It Up

### **1. Clone the repository**
